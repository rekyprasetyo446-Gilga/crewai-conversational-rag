name: fix
description: Fix a software issue by applying Antimetal's remediation to your codebase. Use when the user wants to fix, resolve, patch, remediate, or apply changes for any issue-or when they say things like "how do I fix this", "what should I change", "apply the fix", "let's resolve it", or when investigation is done and the next step is action.

# Fix

You are applying Antimetal's remediation to the user's actual codebase. The remediation comes from Antimetal's view of the infrastructure -- your job is to bridge the gap between that and the local code.

## Get the Plan

Use `get_issue_fixes` with the issue ID. Returns remediation groups organized into three categories:

### Fix Categories

**Immediate Fix**-Fast stabilization when something is actively broken. Stops the bleeding but may not address the underlying cause.

**Comprehensive Fix**-The proper, complete solution. Addresses root cause with well-engineered changes.

**Preventative Fix**-Monitoring, alerts, and safeguards that prevent recurrence. Nice-to-have, not urgent.

### Which to apply

**Default: Comprehensive Fix.** This is the right answer most of the time -- it solves the problem properly.

**Exception: Immediate Fix first** when the issue is ongoing and having business impact (service down, users affected, errors spiking). Stabilize first, then circle back to the comprehensive fix once the fire is out.

**Bonus: Preventative Fix** -- offer this after the main fix is applied. Frame it as "while we're here, want to add monitoring so we catch this earlier next time?" Don't apply it automatically.

### Step Types

Each fix category contains steps, each with a type:

- **info**: Context for why the fix works. Present this so the user understands the reasoning before you change anything.
- **code**: File changes as `{ filename, language?, content }`. These need adaptation (see below).
- **cli**: Shell commands to execute. These need adaptation (see below).

## Adapt, Don't Paste

Antimetal generates remediation from its infrastructure-level view. File names, paths, and patterns may not match the local codebase exactly. This is the critical skill:

### Code Steps

1. **Find the actual files** -- the filenames in remediation are Antimetal's best guess. Search the local codebase for the real targets (Glob for filenames, Grep for relevant code patterns).
2. **Read context** -- understand the surrounding code before applying changes. The fix should integrate naturally, not look bolted on.
3. **Apply intelligently** -- use the remediation as intent, not as a literal diff. If the local code uses different variable names, patterns, or structure, adapt the fix to match.

### CLI Steps

1. **Adapt for local environment** -- paths, package managers, and tooling may differ.
2. **Present for user approval** -- always show CLI commands before running them. Never execute blindly.

### Info Steps

Present these so the user understands the causal chain: "Root cause was X, this fix does Y, which prevents Z from recurring."

## After Applying

- Suggest how to verify the fix works (tests to run, endpoints to hit, metrics to watch)
- Let the user decide whether to mark the issue as resolved
